Outwit is a strategic mobile game where players aim to slide all nine of their chips into their own corner of the board. The game stands out for its unique gameplay mechanics, combining strategy and foresight.

## Game Description
In Outwit, each player starts with nine chips placed in the middle of the board. Players take turns moving a chip towards their corner. There are two types of chips: regular and power chips.
